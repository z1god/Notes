QUALIFY - When we load multiple tables, Qlik automatically associates fields with the same name. If we want to avoid this automatic association, we can use QUALIFY.

QUALIFY statement is used in the data load script to prevent automatic associations between tables by prefixing field names with the table name.

QUALIFY CustomerID;

LOAD CustomerID, ProductID, Sales FROM SalesTable;

LOAD CustomerID, Region FROM CustomerTable;


-> SalesTable.CustomerID

-> CustomerTable.CustomerID



SYNTHETIC KEYS - Synthetic keys are automatically generated when two or more tables share multiple common fields. Instead of creating ambiguous associations, Qlik creates a new synthetic table (named like **$Syn 1**) that contains the combinations of the common key fields.
DISADV -  Increase memory usage and slow down data loading and processing. 
	  Indicate a poorly designed data model.

Resolving Synthetic Keys - Rename fields
		           Use a concatenated key manually
			   Resolve data model logic â€” consider if those fields should really be in both tables.


KEEP - It is used to filter two tables based on join logic without physically joining them. The tables remain separate in the data model.

Sales:
LOAD CustomerID, SalesAmount
FROM Sales.qvd;

INNER KEEP Customers:
LOAD CustomerID, CustomerName
FROM Customers.qvd;

Only CustomerIDs that exist in both Sales and Customers will be kept.

Syntax:  

(inner | left | right) keep [(tablename ) ]( loadstatement | selectstatement )
