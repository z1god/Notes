QLIK SENSE - Qlik Sense is a self-service BI and data visualization tool. It supports responsive design, drag-and-drop UI, governed self-service, and better integration with modern web tech.

Dimensions are fields used to slice data (e.g., Product, Region).

Measures are numeric values to be aggregated (e.g., Sales, Profit).


Different Types of Loads -
1. Inline Load - Used to input small datasets directly in the scriptâ€”great for static lookup tables or manual entries.
	
LOAD * INLINE [  
  A, B  
  1, John  
  2, Jane  
];  


2. Resident Load - Loads data already in memory, enabling further transformations without re-fetching from source. We cannot assign sum and other aggregate functions in a load statement directly to solve this we use Resident load.

SalesAgg:  
LOAD CustomerID, sum(Sales) as TotalSales  
RESIDENT Sales; 


3. Incremental Load
4. Partial Reload
5. Binary Load
6. Buffer Load
7. Add Load
8. Preceding Load
9. Generic Load
10. Mapping Load (ApplyMap)
